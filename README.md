# Redesigning-body-for-poppy-robot

In order to enhance Poppy robot's design, the body part was designed in considerarion of: 
* The arm movements: the design should not be too large to the point it prevents or bothers the arm when bending. Therefore, various tools were utilized to slim its body and then connected at the end. 
* The robot balance: two cylinders were attached at each side to prevent over-weight on the robot and help it balance. 
* Components location: a place on the back was designed for all components. it is inside the middle part of the body. A picture with lables can be found in this file for easier understanding.   

To avoid wasting time, a hand sketch of the design is considered to be important to help visualizing the robot final shape before starting the design process. This would help when selecting the tool needed. A simple sketch of the front and back design, therefore, was made and can be found with the uploaded files.
